<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Lea Wiranatha, and I'm thrilled to have you here. Let me share a little bit about myself.
  </p>

<p>I am passionate about computer science. From a young age, I have been fascinated by how games were created, and my curiosity has led me on an exciting journey of exploration and learning.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing  my education in computer science. During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in Java, Python, CSS, and HTML. This educational background has equipped me with the tools necessary to excel in my field.
</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with United Pacific Bank and Girls Who Code. These experiences have not only sharpened my teamwork and problem solving, but they have also provided me with valuable insights into documentation and time management.
</p>

<p>In my free time, you can often find me dancing and playing golf. I have recently started to dance and take dance classes and thought it was really fun especially with friends. I have been golfing competitively since I was 7 years old and itâ€™s a great opportunity to escape from life a bit and enjoy nature. Golf and dance have definitely helped me improve on coding as they taught me visualization is a useful tool that leads to better results. These activities allow me to unwind, explore new perspectives, and fuel my creativity.
